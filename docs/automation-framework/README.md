Automate your Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts as web-based reports, tools, widgets, dashboards, wizards.

- Reports are documents that update when the data changes.
- Tools are forms that transform input variables into output variables.
- Widgets are interactive visualizations that update when the data changes.
- Dashboards are widgets in a layout.
- Wizards are step-by-step questions that generate a specific web-based report.
